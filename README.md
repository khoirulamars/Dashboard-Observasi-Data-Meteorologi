#  🌡️📊 [Meteorology Data Observation Dashboard: Analysis Urban Heat Island and Albedo Effect] 
Dashboard: https://lnkd.in/giYq4JxY

This project aims to transform raw data into useful information about meteorological data using visualization on Tableau dashboards.

🎯 Objective: To identify the effect of white roof painting on meteorological parameters.

Urban Heat Island (UHI) refers to a phenomenon where temperatures in urban areas are significantly higher compared to the surrounding rural areas. This warming effect occurs due to human activities and urban structures, which absorb and radiate heat, resulting in higher temperatures compared to the surrounding areas.

The albedo effect ☀️ relates to the ability of a surface to reflect solar radiation. Surfaces with a high albedo tend to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat, which can help reduce the UHI effect.

To quantify this phenomenon, we conducted a study using white paint to compare room temperatures before and after painting. We used tools such as an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) and an Internet of Things (IoT) system. The collected data was then analyzed.

📈 The result: After painting the roof, the room temperature tends to be cooler. Air temperature and heat index are lower, while humidity is higher.

📍Data collection by KKN Tematik ITERA 2023/2024 in Kamulyan, Kalirejo, Negeri Katon, Pesawaran Lampung.
